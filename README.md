## Installation
First make sure that [Node](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.
>Note: To check if Node is installed, open up a terminal and enter `node -v`.

If you see something like `vxx.xx.x`, you are good to go.
If you get an error instead, install Node following the instructions on the official [Node](https://nodejs.org/) website.

Now that you have Node installed, run `npm install`.
This will install all the required packages.
